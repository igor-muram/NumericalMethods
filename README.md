# NumericalMethods
Solving systems of linear equations by direct and iterative methods.<br>
LU-decomposition is used as a direct method.<br>
The Jacobi method, the Gauss-Zeidel method, CGM, LOS and the Newton's method are used as iterative methods.<br>
Visualizations using OpenGL and SDL are implemented to demonstrate the convergence process of the Newton's method.<br>
Calculation of the maximum and minimum eigenvalues ​​of the matrix in absolute value.
