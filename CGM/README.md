# CGM
Solving linear systems of equations using the conjugate gradient method and using a locally optimal scheme.
Solution of systems of linear equations without preconditioning of the coefficient matrix.
Implemented LU factorization.
Hilbert matrix generator of any dimension in sparse format.
Implemented three types of diagonal preconditioning for the coefficient matrix for CGM and LOS.
Implemented LU preconditioning of the coefficient matrix for CGM and LOS.
The matrix of coefficients is stored in a sparse row-column format.
The result is a vector x (vector of unknowns), calculated by two methods.
