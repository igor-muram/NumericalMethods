# CGM
Solving linear systems of equations using the conjugate gradient method and using a locally optimal scheme.
Solution of systems of linear equations without pre-conditioning of the coefficient matrix.
The matrix of coefficients is stored in a sparse row-column format.
Implemented LU factorization.
Hilbert matrix generator of any dimension in sparse format.
Implemented diagonal preconditioning of the coefficient matrix.
Implemented LU preconditioning of the coefficient matrix for CGM and LOS.
The result is a vector x (vector of unknowns), calculated by two methods.
