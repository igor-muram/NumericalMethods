# NewtonsMethod
The solution of the system of equations by the Newton method (tangent method).<br>
The matrix of coefficients is stored in a sparse row-column format.<br>
If the number of equations and the number of variables do not match, then the equation that has the smallest absolute value is deleted.<br>
The result is a point that is a solution to a system of equations.
