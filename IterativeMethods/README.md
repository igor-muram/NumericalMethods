# IterativeMethods
Solving systems of linear equations by the iterative methods of Jacobi and Gauss-Zeidel.
Multiplication of the diagonal matrix by vector.
Calculation of the norm of a vector.
The matrix of coefficients is stored in a diagonal format. 
The result is the vector x (vector of unknowns).
